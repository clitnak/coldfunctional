coldfunctional
==============

ColdFunctional is a core language extension for Railo, inspired by Underscore, Ruby, 
Scala, and Clojure. It adds more *functional* programming language support to the 
coldfusion language, by providing more built-in higher-order functions. Just 
install the extension and restart Railo and you can start using this new 
functionality.
